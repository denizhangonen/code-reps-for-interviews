# code-reps-for-interviews

🚀 interview-code-reps
💪 A collection of TDD-style coding exercises and small systems to build speed & confidence for technical interviews.

📚 What’s inside?
This repo is my personal coding gym:

Small systems (like order books, schedulers, shopping carts) built from scratch.

Data structures & algorithm exercises.

All written to sharpen implementation under constraints.

⚙️ Tech stack
JavaScript (ES6+)
React
Typescript
Jest for tests
Maybe more who knows.

🎯 Why?
To become technically fearless.
So never freeze on fundamentals during live interviews — and can focus on clean design & product thinking.

🚀 How to run
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/interview-code-reps.git
